add 0.1 and 0.01 HZ resolution to siggen and sweepgen
Should be possible - add a new configuration param RESOLUTION with
values of 1 10 or 100.

double check. all manual pages - especially siggen, sweepgen and fsynth
I've improved siggen - do similar for sweepgen and fsynth.

	  
	  Add loading of custom waveforms.

oh boy yes.
