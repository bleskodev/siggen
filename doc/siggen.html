<br><center><h2>Jim Jackson &lt;jj@franjam.org.uk&gt;</h2></center>
<center>  <strong>SIGGEN</strong></center>
<center>  <strong>Release 2.3.10  As with all software: there just maybe bugs</strong></center>
<!-- Start SectLevel1 -->
<h2><a name="What are the programs?">What are the programs?</a></h2>
<p class="Body">
This is a set of tools for imitating a laboratory Signal Generator,
generating audio signals out of Linux's /dev/dsp audio device. There is
support for mono and/or stereo and 8 or 16 bit samples. The basic waveform
sample generation code is in the file generator.c, the functions here can be
added to other programs fairly easily. 
</p>
<p class="Body">
The current version can be downloaded from here 
<a class="link" href="http://www.comp.leeds.ac.uk/jj/linux/siggen.tgz">http://www.comp.leeds.ac.uk/jj/linux/siggen.tgz</a>.
</p>
<p class="Body">
This is a bug fix release.
</p>
<p class="Body">
<strong>2.3.10</strong> Release: Paul Martin &amp; Jens Peter Secher (Debian siggen package
maintainer), reported problems with swept waveforms. There was an 
integer overflow problem in some circumstances - usually when 
using the x10 or x100 options.
</p>
<p class="Body">
Also this release changes the config file name from the old <strong>sound.conf</strong>
to <strong>siggen.conf</strong> . Users with existing files can do:
</p>
<div class="block"><pre>
  cd ~
  ln -s .sound.conf siggen.conf
 
as root

  cd /etc
  ln -s sound.conf siggen.conf

or simply copy the files
</pre></div>
<p class="Body">
There should also be less warnings now!
</p>
<p class="Body">
<strong>2.3.9</strong> Release: Lukas Loehrer reported a problem with writing raw
sound files, and Mark Shimonek reported a bug and fix with setting 
the DSP device.
</p>
<p class="Body">
Several of the programs below are front ends for using the generator
functions, mixing the generated outputs and playing them on /dev/dsp. None
of the generation programs control the mixer - use your favourite mixer
program or use the simple mixer 'smix' which I have included here.
</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>soundinfo</strong>   A program to display some of the programming capabilities
    of the sound system support for the mixer device /dev/mixer
    and the DSP device /dev/dsp. Can easily be changed if
    the mixer and dsp devices are called something else. Also
    shows some of the ioctl calls in action :-).\&nbsp;&nbsp;    Further info on your kernel's sound card configuration is
    given by 'cat /dev/sndstat'.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<strong>sgen</strong> is a command line signal generator where
    details are specified from the command line for generating
    sine, cos, square, triangle, sawtooth, pulse, noise waves.
    Frequency, sample rate, relative amplitude etc can be
    specified thru' command line options. The signal is played 
    continuously until the program is stopped. There are options
    to save the basic raw digital samples raw to file or to a WAVE
    format file.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<strong>swgen</strong> is a command line sweep generator. Both the sweeping and swept
    waveforms can be specified, along with the sweeping frequency
    and the swept frequency range. Otherwise similar to sgen above.
</blockquote>
<p class="Body">
    
<blockquote>
<strong>siggen</strong> an Ncurses screen based Signal Generator for 2 seperate channels.
    On stereo audio cards the 2 channels are played on seperate 
    outputs. On mono cards the 2 channels are digitally
    mixed onto the one output. Type of waveform, frequency, amplitude,
    sample rate etc are specified/changed via a screen menu.
    This is version 2. It plays continuously. Changes to parameters
    take effect (nearly) immediately. This version is pretty CPU
    intensive.
</blockquote>
    
<blockquote>
<strong>sweepgen</strong> an Ncurses screen based Sweep generator (see swgen above).
    It is like siggen. Changes to parameters take effect (nearly)
    immediately. 
</blockquote>
 
<blockquote>
<strong>tones</strong> a command line program to generate several successive tones of
    varying freq., and optional differing waveforms, durations and
    intensities.\&nbsp;&nbsp;    The sequence of tones can be either played once (the default), 
    or repetitively or the samples can be written to a file in raw or 
    WAV format. This could make the basis of an auto-dialer for 
    tone phones.\&nbsp;&nbsp;    Check out README.tones and the tones.eg directory for some
    examples of using the tones program.
</blockquote>
</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>smix</strong> a simple command line program for getting and setting the mixer
    settings. (Eee by gum, yet another mixer, yawn).
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<strong>fsynth</strong> an Ncurses based &quot;fourier&quot; synthesis &quot;realtime&quot; generator.
</blockquote>

<h2><a name="Compiling and installing">Compiling and installing</a></h2>
<p class="Body">
You will need the ncurses library and header files. You will need sound card
support compiled into your kernel. You can build some of the programs, tones
sgen and swgen, without soundcard support. These programs then can be used
to generate raw data or WAV files. You can also compile these programs
under other OSes than Linux, e.g. Sunos 4.1.
</p>
<p class="Body">
Edit the configuration file config.h, to set the options/defaults you require.
The defaults assume compilation under Linux with soundcard support.
The file has ample comments and should be self explanatory. If anyone wants
to suggest changes for building under other OSes then let me know and 
I'll inlcude the changes.
</p>
<p class="Body">
Check out the Makefile and edit anything that is wrong for your system. The
ncurses library is assumed to be in normal library 'path' and the
ncurses include file is assumed to be in either /usr/include/curses or
/usr/include/ncurses/curses . If not, edit as appropriate. Just type 'make'
to make the programs.
</p>
<p class="Body">
Don't set -Wall in the makefile, the results will be deeply embarassing to
yours truly :-)
</p>
<p class="Body">
All the programs support optional interrogation of a common set of 
configuration files. See <strong>CONFIG.FILES</strong> for details.
</p>
<p class="Body">
Type 'make sysinstall' to install the programs into /usr/local/bin and the
man pages into /usr/local/man/man1. Type 'make localinstall' to install into
$HOME/bin and $HOME/man/man1. If none of these are ok for you then copy
manually or edit the Makefile. Edit the setting of variable PROGS to
customise which programs you install, e.g. you may not wish to install yet
another mixer program so delete smix from the list.
</p>
<p class="Body">
These programs have been tested on on various versions of Linux from
Kernels 2.0.36 - 2.6.22, and on distributions from RedHat et al., Debian
and Ubuntu. Seems to work with ALSA or OSS, and I have reports of it porting to FreeBSD easily. Compiled with no sound card support, the command line utilities
should work for creating sound files on most *nix OSes.
