SIGGEN
------

See the siggen.aft files for an overview (or the derived file siggen.html).
If you aren't familiar with Almost Free Text (AFT) then, no problem, just 
more or less the file. It should be readable as ASCII text.

There are manual pages for each utility. To read try

  nroff -man siggen.1 | less

or install man pages into a suitable location and use man.

Finally there is the source.

Oh! There is a README.tones with info about the example directory (tones.eg)
for the tones program.
